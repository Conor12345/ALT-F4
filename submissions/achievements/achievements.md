## Gotta catch em' all - Factorio Achievements <author>Conor_</author>

Factorio achievements were introduced all the way back in [version 0.13](https://wiki.factorio.com/Version_history/0.13.0#0.13.0)

### The magical design of Factorio achievements

Currently, Factorio has 38 achievements in the vanilla game. These range from basics such as *Eco unfriendly* (simply requiring you to research oil processing), all the way up to *Mass production 3* (requiring you to produce 20 **M**illion green circuits). The craziest thing about this mix of achievements is they can theorectically (and in practice) all be procured in a single Factorio save.
